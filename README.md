# Tic Tac Toe
A command line version of the famous Tic Tac Toe game.

## Why another Tic Tac Toe (and such a boring one)?
Just to practice my programming skills (especially my software design skills)

## Installation
Fork or clone this repo.

## Running
Create a driver using the tests/usage.rb as reference or directly run it using command:

	ruby tests/usage.rb
	
## Contributing
I am currently working on the web version of this game (practicing my Rails skills). If you have any suggestions, please create an issue or make a pull request. Thank you!
